# Study Guide questions for CrashCourse Computer Science v0.1

## Questions accompany the learning videos:

This resource is a set of companion questions to the excellent CrashCourse Computer Science videos on YouTube. It also explains how you can use these questions and videos as a study guide and get the most of the CrashCourse Computer Science course: at home by yourself; with friends in a study group; or as a teacher with a group students. 

## Questions enable you to watch mindfully:

Each episode of the CrashCourse video is about 10-15 minutes long, and these questions will enable you to watch it more mindfully and try to extract the most important and valuable elements of the video. To answer the questions you will need to really tune in to the video, which means you will watch it more carefully and retain more information.

## How to use these questions:

Answer the questions in a paper notebook, digital text file, or in any way that you'd like. What matters is that you try to answer them by yourself. Some questions are just about things that were described in the video, some requite you to do some thinking by yourself, while some will require you to even do some simple maths. If you're not sure of the answer, just leave it blank - many questions don't have one-and-only correct answers, so you won't be given answers - if unsure, rewatch the video in question.


## Some notes about the Crash Course Computer Science videos:

- These are 40 episodes taking 10 minutes each.
- Episodes can be watched on Youtube.
- Videos cover a log of knowledge from the first year of Computer Science University Course.
- Below are some questions for each episode that might help you check if you got the most important parts 

## If you would like to help in further creation of this resource:

- If you found mistakes/errors/typos etc. you can use the 'Issues' on github. Click Issiues > New Issue and erxplain your suggested improvement
- If you would like to add more questions, or episodes, you can use the 'Pull request' feature on github.
- Still :) it might be easiest if you just email the author, and discuss your suggestions.

## What is the Licence on these questions? Can I use these questions for anything I want?

Yes, this learning resource is Creative Commons (like eg. Wikipedia) so you can use them for anything you'd like eg. in your classroom, for printing, as a digital handout. Thic concerns only the questions (not the videos) - the videos themselves are created by CrashCourse and they are the holders of the copyright and specify its licence.
